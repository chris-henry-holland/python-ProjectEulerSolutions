<h1>Graph classes repository</h1>

This contains a collection of classes representing different types of mathematical graph (i.e. directed and undirected, weighted and unweighted) and implementations of different
graph and network algorithms. This includes the ability to define graphs based on other structures, for example graphs based around grid traversal that have been constructed.

<h2>Development</h2>

This package was written primarily as practice and experimentation in object oriented programming techniques (in particular inheritance and polymorphism) and unit testing.
As a project of relatively limited scope but potential for expansion, I used this as a kind of sandbox for trying out different ideas for creating a framework that is above
all robust, flexible and expansible. To this end, the algorithms are almost certainly not the most performant in terms of speed or memory usage, as this was a secondary
consideration.

I also used this project as a way to practice and develop my techniques in unit testing.
